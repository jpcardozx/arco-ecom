# ARCO Project Architecture

## Core Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**

   - Each component and feature should have one definitive implementation
   - Avoid suffixes like "Enhanced", "Revised" unless part of an A/B test

2. **Performance First**

   - Component lazy loading for optimal initial page load
   - Analytics events batching and throttling
   - Image optimization and modern formats (WebP, AVIF)

3. **Maintainable Internationalization**

   - Centralized translation management
   - Language detection with user preferences
   - SEO-friendly URL structure

4. **Clean Architecture**
   - Feature-based folder structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Shared UI components in `components/ui`
   - Business logic in `modules`

## Component Strategy

### Current State

- Multiple versions of components exist (Basic, Enhanced, Revised)
- Need for consolidation based on A/B test results

### Migration Path

1. Analyze metrics for each component version
2. Consolidate into single best-performing version
3. Maintain clean interfaces for future evolution

## Performance Optimization

### Current Implementation

- Dynamic imports for large components
- Image optimization pipeline
- Analytics batching

### Next Steps

1. Implement proper code splitting
2. Add server-side caching strategy
3. Optimize translation loading

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests: Components and utilities
2. Integration Tests: Page flows
3. Performance Tests: Core metrics
4. A/B Testing: Feature variants

## Monitoring

1. Core Web Vitals
2. User Flow Analytics
3. Error Tracking
4. Performance Metrics

## Development Guidelines

1. Use TypeScript strict mode
2. Follow component composition patterns
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Document all major changes

## Deployment Strategy

1. Staging environment for QA
2. Gradual rollout of features
3. Feature flags for risk management
4. Automated rollback procedures
