## ðŸŽ¯ **Final Assessment: PASSED âœ…**

### **Summary:**
The modular component architecture has been successfully implemented with:

1. **Professional Navigation** with variant support and clean TypeScript interfaces
2. **Flexible Hero Component** with multiple layout options and proper prop handling
3. **Reusable Section Components** with consistent styling and spacing systems
4. **Clean ModernLayout** that composes components in a maintainable pattern
5. **Harmonized Spacing System** using design tokens throughout
6. **Consistent Typography** and color systems from ARCO design tokens
