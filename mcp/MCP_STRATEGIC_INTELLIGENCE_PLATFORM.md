## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### PHASE 1: MCP FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-2) - REVISED FOR COMPETITIVE REALITY

#### Week 1a: Strategic Validation Foundation

**Manual Intelligence Analysis (No Code - Maximum ROI validation)**

- Document 10 real cross-dimensional decisions from current ARCO work
- Measure baseline decision confidence score (1-10) and time-to-decision
- Identify specific integration points where technical choices impact business outcomes
- Validate that integrated intelligence would provide measurable competitive advantage vs agencies

**Operational Metrics Definition:**

```typescript
interface BaselineDecisionMetrics {
  decisionConfidence: number; // 1-10 self-assessment before MCP
  timeToDecision: number; // Minutes from question to confident choice
  crossDimensionalAwareness: number; // Did decision consider tech + business + competitive impact?
  implementationSuccess: number; // Did decision lead to desired outcome? (retroactive)
}
```

**Week 1a Success Gate:** Clear evidence that sophisticated intelligence integration addresses real competitive gaps worth 40% development time investment

#### Week 1b: Core MCP Server Architecture

**Strategic Intelligence Server (`arco-intelligence-server.ts`)**
