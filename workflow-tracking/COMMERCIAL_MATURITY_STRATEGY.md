# ARCO - Enterprise Commercial Maturity Framework
## Strategic Transformation: Digital Infrastructure Practice Development

**Document Version**: v3.0 Enterprise  
**Review Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Classification**: Strategic Implementation Blueprint  
**Approval Required**: Technical Leadership, Business Development

---

## Executive Summary

This framework establishes ARCO's evolution from emerging consultancy to recognized digital infrastructure practice, targeting mid-market enterprises ($50M-$500M revenue) requiring systematic technology optimization. Our strategic positioning addresses the critical gap between high-overhead management consultancies and tactical development agencies.

**Primary Objective**: Position ARCO as the definitive mid-market digital infrastructure optimization practice, commanding premium rates through demonstrable expertise and measurable outcomes.

**Market Opportunity**: $2.8B annually in mid-market digital inefficiency across LATAM, with 73% of organizations lacking systematic optimization capabilities.
